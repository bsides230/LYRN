Most AI systems forget who they are between turns.

They re-prompt, re-fetch, and re-instruct—treating memory as an afterthought. LYRN changes that.  
It moves cognition out of the prompt and into structure.

This repo contains the foundational papers behind LYRN, a self-hosted AI framework that enables even small, local LLMs to reason with **presence, continuity, and identity**—without cloud dependencies or fine-tuning.

## 🔍 What is LYRN?

LYRN is a local-first AI system that enables:

- **Live symbolic memory** (identity, tone, projects, emotion)
- **Inline cognition loops** that avoid prompt injection
- **Heartbeat cycles** that update memory between turns
- **CPU-based deployment** with zero cloud reliance

It doesn’t just simulate presence. It *holds* it.
